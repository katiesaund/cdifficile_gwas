# Goal: write a whole bunch of sbat files to submit and run simultaneously
#       These elastic net models will have many different options and then 
#       we'll compare the performance of models. 
# We're going to run for all of the 8 phenotypes
# We'll also include a negative controls for each of those phenotypes. 
# 3 negative controls: phenotype completely scrambeled on the tree. 
# Options for pyseer
# --wg enet fits an elastic net to all variants 
# --n-folds cross-validation (default 10-fold).
# --save-model saves the fitted model so it can be used for prediction.
# --cpu uses four cores efficiently during cross-valdation.
# --alpha controls the mixing between ridge regression and lasso regression. Above we have used a value of 1, which is lasso regression, selecting just a few variants. We can use a value closer to ridge regression if desired, which will select more variants with smaller effect sizes. "Sets the mixing between ridge regression (0) and lasso regression (1) in the above formula. Default is 0.0069 (closer to ridge regression)"
# --phenotypes  phenotype file
# --lineage-clusters has two effects. Cross-validation will be performed by leaving one strain out. This will usually take longer as there are more strains than folds, but may help reduce the number of lineage effects included. Also, training predition accuracy for each lineage will be reported, making it easier to see whether there are some parts of the data where the model is performing better. For binary phenotypes ùëÖ2 can be difficult to interpret, so true/false positives/negatives are also reported.
# --sequence-reweighting has one further effect. Within each lineage, the weight ùë§ùëñ given to each sample in the loss function
