# PhyC Individual Loci Results

Phylogenetic tree with high interest genotype heatmap and a barplot of the phenotype. 

![](../figures/gwas_results/fqR_phyc_indiv_results_tree_w_ribo_sig_pval_hi_epsilon_hits_heatmap_and_pheno_barplot.png)

A Manhattan Plot of all tested variants.

P-value vs. Epsilon 
![](../figures/gwas_results/fqR_indiv_phyc_pval_vs_convergence.png)
Variants that were fed to hogwash (left), successfully tested (center), and then considered high interest (right).
![](../figures/gwas_results/fqR_phyc_variant_funnel_through_hogwash_indiv.jpg)

The same plot as above, but now divided by type of genomic variant (SNP, Indel, or accessory gene).
