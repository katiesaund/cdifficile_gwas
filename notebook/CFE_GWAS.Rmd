# Individual Loci Results

Phylogenetic tree with high interest genotype heatmap and a barplot of the phenotype. 
-- Doesn't get created for CFE because no hits of interest in the heatmap.

A Manhattan Plot of all tested variants.

P-value vs. Epsilon 
![](../figures/gwas_results/log_cfe_indiv_pval_vs_convergence.png)

Variants that were fed to hogwash (left), successfully tested (center), and then considered high interest (right).

The same plot as above, but now divided by type of genomic variant (SNP, Indel, or accessory gene).
